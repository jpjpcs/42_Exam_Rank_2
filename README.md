##📝 **Last Notes**

I also followed Filipe Duque github regarding the exercices organization, Luís Balsa github regarding exercice resolution and JCluzet github to know how to launch the exam simulator. In my github I only have the exercices I made to study to the exam (I don´t have all the exercices. So it´s better for you to check Filipe Duque and Luís Balsa githubs).
