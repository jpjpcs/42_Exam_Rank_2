##üìù **Last Notes**

I also followed Filipe Duque github regarding the exercices organization, Lu√≠s Balsa github regarding exercice resolution and JCluzet github to know how to launch the exam simulator. In my github I only have the exercices I made to study to the exam (I don¬¥t have all the exercices. So it¬¥s better for you to check Filipe Duque and Lu√≠s Balsa githubs).
