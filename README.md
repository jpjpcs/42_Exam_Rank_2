# 42 Exam rank 2

##📝 **From where I study**

I followed Filipe Duque, Luís Balsa and JCluzet github.

- Filipe Duque github: https://github.com/fduquea/42_exams?tab=readme-ov-file
- Luís Balsa github: https://github.com/LuisBalsa/42_Exam_Level_2
- JCluzet github: https://github.com/JCluzet/42_EXAM

##📝 **How I study**

1 - I followed Filipe Duque github regarding the exercises organization (Filipe has the exercises organized by levels, which was very good for the mental organization also).

2- I followed Luís Balsa github regarding exercise resolution. Luís made simple code with few lines. That is very beneficial to make clear, understandable, and clean code.

3- I followed JCluzet github to know how to launch the exam simulator. 

In my github I only have the exercises that I had made to study for the exam - I don´t have all the exercises. So it´s better for you to check Filipe Duque and Luís Balsa githubs.
  
##📝 **To Remember Notes**
